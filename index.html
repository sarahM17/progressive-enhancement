        <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, </p><blockquote class="the-villagers"><strong>"We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. <br> This is morst unfortunate."</strong></blockquote><p>The farmer said,</p> <blockquote class="the-farmer"><em><strong>"Maybe."</strong></em></blockquote> <p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p> <blockquote class="the-villagers"><strong>"Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. <br> You now have eight horses!"</strong></blockquote> <p>The farmer again said,</p> <blockquote class="the-farmer"><em><strong>"Maybe."</strong></em></blockquote>
        <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <blockquote class="the-villagers"><strong>“Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span>,”</strong></blockquote> <p>and the farmer responded,</p> <blockquote class="the-farmer"><em><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></em> </blockquote> <p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p> <blockquote class="the-villagers"><strong>“Isn’t that great!”</strong></blockquote> <p>Again, he said,</p> <blockquote class="the-farmer"><em><strong>“Maybe.”</strong></em></blockquote>
        <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><strong><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective.</strong><blockquote><em>"Bananas are <span class="good">good</span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas."</em> Let's not make a big deal out of it...</blockquote>
